# Project Learnings

## Fresh Framework Initialization

- Fresh 2.0.0 is not yet available on deno.land/x. The latest stable version is Fresh 1.7.3, which works perfectly for this project.
- Fresh project structure requires:
  - `deno.json` with Fresh imports and tasks
  - `dev.ts` for development server
  - `main.ts` for production server
  - `fresh.config.ts` for configuration
  - `fresh.gen.ts` for route manifest (auto-generated)
  - `routes/` directory for page routes
  - `static/` directory for static assets
- The dev server starts on localhost:8000 by default
- Fresh uses Preact for components and supports TypeScript out of the box
- The `deno task start` command runs the development server with hot reload
